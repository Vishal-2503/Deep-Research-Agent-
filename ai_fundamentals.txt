Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Core AI research areas include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing (NLP), perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. The long-term goals of AI research include achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
