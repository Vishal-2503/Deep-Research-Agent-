A large language model (LLM) is a type of AI model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. LLMs are built on complex neural network architectures, most commonly the Transformer architecture. They are capable of a wide range of tasks, such as translation, summarization, and question answering. Prominent examples include models from the GPT series, LLaMA, and Mistral.
